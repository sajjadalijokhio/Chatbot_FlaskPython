# Chatbot using Flask and NLTK

This is a simple chatbot implementation using Flask, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot can respond to user inputs with predefined patterns and provide a conversational interface through a web page.

## Features

- Greet users and respond to common greetings.
- Provide a name for the chatbot.
- Handle user queries and respond with pre-defined patterns.
- User-friendly web interface.

## How It Works

1. The chatbot is built using Python and the Flask web framework. The chatbot's core functionality is defined in the Python script.

2. It uses NLTK for natural language processing to match user input with predefined patterns. When a user enters a message, the chatbot analyzes the text to find a matching pattern.

3. The predefined patterns and responses are defined in the `patterns` list within the Python code. The chatbot selects an appropriate response based on the matched pattern.

4. The web interface is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with the chatbot by typing their messages into an input field and clicking the "Send" button or pressing "Enter."

5. When a user sends a message, the web interface communicates with the Flask backend. The message is sent to the chatbot running on the server.

6. The chatbot generates a response based on the user's input and sends it back to the web interface.

7. The web interface displays both the user's messages and the chatbot's responses in a chat-like format.
